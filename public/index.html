                    Water treatment systems, treating to remove contaminants in drinking water from ground wells, (utilizing ion exchange technology or “IX”) were built with programmable logic controllers (PLC) and human-to-machine interfaces (HMIs). The PLC produced a tremendous amount of data that was then captured and logged by the HMI. This data was later collected by the operations staff in the first step toward generating operational reports. 
                    <p>Using Excel, the operations staff sifted through data, eliminating spurious data. The list of criteria for recognizing bad data included periods of no information, signifying that the computer had been shutdown or had somehow crashed; values at the extreme end of the scale, i.e. 32,768, or 20 mA, or a number signifying the maximum engineering value, usually caused by a broken wire or electrical event; or specific numbers used as filler during times when readings were not to be taken. </p>
                    <p>Tens of hours could be expended every month on finding and removing spurious data. Afterward, the data was then used to generate graphs, calculate averages, minimum values, maximum values, and totals. Then, uptime was calculated. </p>
                    <p>Utilizing C#, a program was written that iterated through and evaluated all data, removing any data that violated the given criteria. This alone significantly simplified the reporting process. </p>
                    <p>Following this, the program was expanded, incorporating COM elements that allowed for communication with and utilization of the Microsoft Excel and Word APIs. Using Excel, the data was funneled into cells and then graphs showing runtime, flow rates, and measured contaminant levels were created. The graphs were then taken and placed into Microsoft Word. </p>
                    <p>Operator logs containing descriptions of maintenance, repairs, and resolutions, were kept electronically in CSV format on the HMIs as well, so the program read in the information, formatted, and built tables within Word, displaying the logged events. </p>
                    <p>In total, the entire report generation process was automated, requiring only proof reading and final inspection of the resulting calculations. 
                    A typical report often required three days to complete, but was reduced to five minutes with the implementation of this software. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div id="ol-explanation-4">
                    The project was a data reporting and notification program written in .NET Visual Basic (later converted to C#). The software was maintained, regularly receiving optimization and feature enhancements.
                    <p>Water treatment systems, treating to remove contaminants in drinking water from ground wells, (utilizing ion exchange technology or “IX”) were placed in geographically diverse locations, often with only an analog phone line for remote access. The operations team needed feedback from each system, but had to use an analog modem connection to manually, remotely access and retrieve data each day.</p> 
                    <p>When a system would encounter a failure, an alarm condition triggered, and an auto-dialer device would call from the site through a list of phone numbers, playing a pre-recorded message. The message lacked specific information pertaining to the circumstances of the event, requiring staff to get to a computer and phone line in order to remotely access the systems to determine what had actually happened.</p>
                    <p>The IX Info Up program ran as a service and started with Windows. It was accessed by double clicking its icon in the task tray, revealing a form when it appeared. </p>
                    <p>The program read from a flat file generated by the HMI local to the treatment system. The data was then formatted for use in an HTML table which was then placed into an email and sent via SMTP to a list of recipients. </p>                    <p>Recipient profiles were saved in a SQLite database.  Each of the profiles was configurable, giving users the option to change the notifications that reached them and set how often regular status reports were sent to them. </p>
                    <p>When an alarm condition occurred, the HMI would generate a flat file with a special message indicating an alarm had occurred. A complete snapshot of the system’s state at the time of the failure was contained in the email notification. </p>
                    <p>The program also sent regular spreadsheet data served up by the HMI, expediting the reporting process and enabling faster data-driven troubleshooting.</p>
                    <p>Hours of time were saved for staff. Because alarm notifications came with contextual information, troubleshooting was dramatically aided, leading to quick resolutions and often eliminating the need for remotely accessing the system to determine the fault. This program led to countless operational improvements.</p>
                    <p>Following the development of this software, two water districts requested similar notification software, so the program was taken and further adapted to allow for use on two Water District SCADA systems.</p>
